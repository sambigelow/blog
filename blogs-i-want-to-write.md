# Blog Posts I Want To Write

- **How I am using BEM:** some really practical applications of BEM. What are
  the components required for this page? How did I decide them? Where did I
  struggle? Maybe I should build the fat marker sketch first and then use that
  to pull out the components? Or not using BEM? i.e. I think I am going to use
  CUBE css
- **Homage to Swyx, and other inspirations:** This blog, so far has been pretty
  inspired by [swyx](swyx.io). I'm trying to figure out exactly what I want this
  to be, but I'd like to talk about these inspirations and what I'm pulling from
  these inspirations
- **Review of "Grokking Algorithms":** I haven't read the book yet, but I heard
  Rachel Nabors gush about it and I really want to read it. This is kind of
  "Picking Up What They Put Down" (TODO: Link to that blog from swyx) except for
  the fact that it's not really new. But I think it'd still be helpful.
- **CS50:** Talk about what CS50 did for me and give it credit for where I am
  now.

## Some Possible Link Posts

First of all, I'm still kind of figuring out what this means. Chris Coyier seems
to use it a lot on Shoptalk show and I think the idea is basically just writing
some stuff about an article or blog post or whatever I read. One I'd really like
to do this on is a talk that Dave Rupert mentioned in some episode of the
podcast about how SVG tags work... but I can't remember what it is. Another is a
podcast episode from "Focus on Code" with Jeremy Keith. That thing blew me away
