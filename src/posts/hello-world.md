Welcome to my blog! The goal of this site is to [learn in public]
(https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). I am also using it to trick my brain
into organizing my thoughts a bit better.

## Building This Blog

For my first few posts, I'll discuss building this blog. Obviously, a blog isn't
a super hard thing to build at it's root. There are all sorts of tools to make
it super easy. I could pull in Hugo and just write markdown through a theme.
There are a million off the shelf things.

I don't want to go that route though. I've been a developer for over four years
and I really want to build this thing from scratch. I'm using it as an
opportunity to get back to the basics. I want to do some deeper dives into the
world of typography, color, accessibility, and progressive enhancement and I
intend to do those dives through this blog.
