I have next to no experience picking colors. I just need to get something here
though so I can move on to the next stuff for now. I ended up just using some
built in CSS colors. It was kind of fun experimenting here.

If you aren't interested in opening the devtools to see it - here is what I
chose (for now).

```css
body {
  background-color: papayawhip;
  color: darkslategrey;
}

a {
  color: ;
}
```
