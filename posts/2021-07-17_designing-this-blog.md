# Designing This Blog

<!-- Excerpt Start -->

As I'm writing this, the only CSS on this site is from normalize css. I have no
mock ups nor any other form of design. I'm writing this _as I design_ the site.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

So the first question I want to ask myself is, "What is this website supposed to
be?" It's not necessarily an easy question to answer. As I stated in
[my first post](../2021-07-15_hello-world), this is supposed to be me "Learning
in Public". I'd like to talk about things as I'm learning about them. So, I
guess it is really just a blog. A place for me to post my thoughts online.

So, it really should be pretty simple. When people come to my site, they
probably want a really brief explanation of who I am and why I have some
authority to talk about the subjects, then they may want the content on the
site.

## Who is my audience?

Who are the people that are going to be here though? Defining your audience is
obviously an important first step in writing any content as well as making a
design. For now, I don't really intend to have an audience. It is mostly for me
to talk about what I'm learning. So I'd say, simply, the audience is me.
However, there _is_ a reason I am posting this publicly. First of all, I just
want to. I want to have _some sort_ of online presence. If I meet somebody
interested in programming, I'd like to have something to point them to where I
can show a bit of what sort of work I do. Also, the sort of work I do is
building websites! _I should have my own website!_

I also think I have some aspirations of this becoming at least somewhat useful
to more people down the road. And I think to do that,
[consistency is key](https://chriscoyier.net/2020/09/06/the-key-to-blogging-success/).

So I don't necessarily know who I am trying to be helpful to, but essentially it
is people like me. Or maybe just me, but yesterday? Or maybe even me, but today
or tomorrow! For example, today I am writing this so I have something to go off
of as I build my
["fat marker sketches"](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#fat-marker-sketches)\*
So what would I want this to look like if I were looking for help designing my
site today? That is probably the person I'm designing this for the most. It is
one of the reasons I'm writing several posts, because consistency provides
credibility. It allows the reader to learn more about the author's thoughts and
opinions and determine if they align with their own as well as if their goals
align. It helps them determine if the content is worth reading. I would want to
know who the author is and what they do. Are they a designer, a developer, a
product manager, or something else? How long have they worked in the field? What
is their background? What do they like about the web? What else have they done?
What is their day job? I probably don't need to know all of that information at
first - so it is worth narrowing that list of questions down a bit, and maybe
answering more in some sort of "About" page. but a really quick elevator pitch
would be helpful on the home page.

On the home page, I'd want to see a list of posts. What else is this person
writing? This is a blog, after all. The home page is just a list of posts.

Then, when looking at the blog itself, I don't want any distractions. It should
just look like a newspaper column or something. Maybe an image here or there, a
title, some headings and subheadings - but not a whole bunch of sidebar crap. I
don't want to be overwhelmed with links to other sites distracting from this
post. I just want to read the content. That last point is something I think
about a lot. Is there a better way to organize the links than just inline? Maybe
I can do them inline, but let readers know ahead of time that they will all be
included in some sort of index at the end.

\* I don't love quoting basecamp at this point considering all of the turmoil
and prejudice going on there. They do have a lot of good ideas though and it
definitely has influenced the way I think about software and my career.
