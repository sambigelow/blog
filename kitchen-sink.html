  This is a paragraph tag. Below this paragraph, I'm going to reference a
  blockquote from another post on this blog. I'm also going to say a bunch of
  other shit that doesn't matter just so I can fill the paragraph tag
</p>

  We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs
  began to take hold. I remember saying something like "I feel a bit
  lightheaded; maybe you should drive. . . ." And suddenly there was a terrible
  roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all
  swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a
  hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was
  screaming "Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?"

  Then it was quiet again. My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring
  beer on his chest, to facilitate the tanning process. "What the hell are you
  yelling about?" he muttered, staring up at the sun with his eyes closed and
  covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. "Never mind," I said. "It's your
  turn to drive." I hit the brakes and aimed the Great Red Shark toward the
  shoulder of the highway. No point mentioning those bats, I thought. The poor
  bastard will see them soon enough.

  Another possibility for a deeper "First Principle" is writing an HTTP server
  without any libraries. I know so little about this side, but that's the point!
  How do I connect some client to some other machine somewhere and make them
  interact? Again, I'm just interested in building an extremely small subset of
  features here, just enough to understand how it works.
